# Interactive Molecular Transformation App

This is a Streamlit web application for visualizing and transforming molecular structures interactively. Users can select different molecules, apply transformations, and visualize the results in 3D.

## Features
- Select and visualize molecules such as CH₄, O₂, H₂O, and more.
- Apply transformations like rotation, translation, and atom swapping.
- View transformed positions and molecular properties.
- Interactive 3D molecular visualization using `py3Dmol`.

## Usage

1. **Access the application:**
   - You can open the app directly using this [website link](https://interactivemolecules-9jdne3eohsikroemn7mtlx.streamlit.app/).
   - Or, start the application locally by running the command:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
2. **Use the sidebar to:**
   - **Select a molecule** (e.g., CH₄, O₂, H₂O).
   - **Adjust transformation parameters** such as rotation, translation, and atom swapping.
   - **Choose a descriptor** to display the local environment of molecules.

3. **View the results**:
   - See the transformed positions in the main panel.
   - Interact with the 3D molecular visualization to explore the molecule from different angles.
